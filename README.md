# Project Description

WAFlulz is a work in progress starting with Web Application Firewall (WAF) recon, with plans to move on to mapping and exploitation. Currently only WAF detection functionality is included. Most regex's for detection modules came from the sqlmap source for --identify-waf option. Some additional plugins or modifications have been done.

WAFlulz includes a proxy randomization function, but you will need to populate the httpproxy and httpsproxy text files with your own selection of proxies using the format shown there. We do not endorse the proxies listed currently, these were just ones that were used for initial testing based on the HMA lists.

Additionally completely passive recon capabilities have been included to fingerprint WAFs without sending any traffic to them. Several User-Agent choices are also available to choose from, including mobile browsers.

Currently, normal, modsecurity and aggressive modes are enabled, however aggressive mode fingerprints are still a work in progress.

Python-Requests is REQUIRED for usage. Install with $ pip install requests or $ easy_install requests
